Ancient Greek is a tonal language whose cadence of rising and falling pitches were closely linked with the rise and fall of the melody in traditional sung performances. By the time of our play in late fifth-century Athens, Euripides and others were experimenting with a more emphatic, imitative style in music and probably dance as well: music and movement become particularly prominent in late-fifth century performance. In the Herakles, Euripides evokes a more traditional type of play like Aeschylus’ Agamemnon and then dramatically unravels its traditional musical and ethical framework with an avant-garde musical performance by Madness personified (Lyssa in the Greek). Director Caleb Simone in his research on aulos performance culture is especially interested in how the live aulos music would have broken into this play’s dramatic action, something that does happen to the same degree in other surviving tragedies. Euripides’ Herakles showcases the powerful ways the aulos was felt to affect the body of its hearer in Greek culture, which is why this play is particularly suited to being staged within the sonic framework of this unique instrument."),i.a.createElement("p",null,"Composer Anna Conser, drawing on her doctoral research on the melodic structure of Greek tragic song, has reconstructed the more traditional odes in the play, where the “turn” and “return” (",i.a.createElement("em",null,"strophe")," and ",i.a.createElement("em",null,"anti-strophe"),") movements share the same basic melody. These melodies are composed in the traditional “keys” or “modes” of ancient Greek music culture. Piper (or “Aulete”) Callum Armstrong has composed accompaniment for Anna’s songs on the aulos, following current working hypotheses among scholars of Greek music. His aulos is itself something of an innovation:  developed by music historian and reed expert Robin Howell of Toronto, Callum’s aulos is an adaptation from various surviving archaeological remains of double-pipes, especially a set called the “Elgin” currently in London in the British Museum. Much like the professional aulos-players of Euripides’ day would typically have their own custom set of pipes, Robin has designed this instrument for Callum to accommodate the musical feats planned for the performance."),i.a.createElement("p",null,"While the production’s musical design is marked with a high degree of reconstruction, our vision is not fully reconstructionist.
